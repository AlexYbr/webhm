It is not true that the course relies on Matlab 					-> Yes, we calcul on paper or on excel directly
It is possible to use Excel? 										-> Yes
Are you are forced to use Matlab?									-> Lab are asked to be realise on mathlab (proof on paper)
When was the last time you were asked/forced to use Matlab?			-> Each lab
Does the teacher use Matlab during lectures?						-> Not on lecture

Remaining labs will be also based on Excel too or any other tool 	-> So why it is write mathlab on the instructions
comfortable to a student and nobody will be forced to use Matlab 
(Matlab is an option). 

If "more than half the students are having difficulties with 		-> Because excel is less good mark than Mathlab
MATLAB" so why they use Matlab instead of Excel? 

Referring to the sentence "Would it at all be possible to adapt 	-> Yes but excel is less good mark than Mathlab
the remaining labs and lectures to this request and shift the 
emphasis to a simpler tool" -- it's done -- students can choose 
practically any tool. I'm sure that Excel is (should be 
for students) the easiest one.

As a teacher, a person responsible for students, I'm sure that 		-> Of course
a course should develop skills and knowledge, and should be 
valuable for students, not only at the moment, but also in the 
future.  

Finally, few days ago I asked Claude to talk to his colleagues 		-> We wait for an answer of efrei about the fact that we use Mathlab and C/C++
and let me know (via e-mail) if any changes of rules are 
needed. I have not received any mail.
